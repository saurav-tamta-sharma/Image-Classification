**Image Classification using Tensorflow:**

This project demonstrates how to classify images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset

**Features:**   
Classify Images: Classifies images into categories such as airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship and truck. Image Preview: Displays images from a local directory before classification.

**Prerequisites**:   
Python 3.x TensorFlow Matplotlib Pillow

*You can install the required packages using* pip: **pip install tensorflow matplotlib pillow**

**Model:**   
The model is a CNN trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model file (cifar10\_with\_man\_model.h5) should be placed in the root directory of this project.
